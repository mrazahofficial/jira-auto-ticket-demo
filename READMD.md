🔐 Automated CI Security Incident Management System
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a DevSecOps automation workflow that integrates:

GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Python automation
Jira Cloud REST API (v3)
Slack Incoming Webhooks
When a CI security scan detects a vulnerability, the system:

Automatically creates a structured Jira ticket
Sets severity and priority
Sends a real-time Slack notification to the IT Support team
This project simulates a production-grade automated incident response pipeline.

🏗 Architecture
Developer Push → GitHub Actions CI ↓ Security Scan Script ↓ (if failure) Create Jira Incident ↓ Send Slack Alert to IT Channel

🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ Code Push
A developer pushes code to the GitHub repository.

2️⃣ CI Security Scan
GitHub Actions runs security_scan.py.

If a vulnerability is detected:

Script exits with code 1
Workflow continues to Jira automation step
3️⃣ Jira Ticket Creation
create_jira_ticket.py:

Calls Jira REST API /rest/api/3/issue
Creates issue using Atlassian Document Format (ADF)
Sets priority (e.g., High)
Logs API response
4️⃣ Slack Notification
If Jira returns HTTP 201:

Slack webhook sends formatted alert
IT Support channel receives real-time notification
🛠 Technology Stack
GitHub Actions – CI/CD automation
Python (requests library) – API integration
Jira Cloud API v3 – Issue management
Slack Incoming Webhooks – Real-time alerting
GitHub Secrets – Secure credential storage
🔐 Security Best Practices Implemented
No credentials stored in source code
All secrets managed via GitHub Secrets
HTTPS API communication
Environment variable validation
Structured JSON payload formatting
Error handling and status logging
